# Password Manager App - System Design

## Implementation approach
After analyzing the codebase of the existing Password Manager App, I propose the following improvements to enhance security, usability, and maintainability:

1. **Architecture Upgrade**: Migrating from the current structure to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to better separate concerns and improve testability.

2. **Storage Enhancement**: Replace SharedPreferences with Room Database for improved data management, query capabilities, and type safety.

3. **Security Improvements**: Implement industry-standard encryption (AES-256) for all sensitive data at rest, integrate biometric authentication, and add secure password generation.

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation with clear user feedback.

5. **Modularization**: Organize code into features (passwords, credit cards, secure notes) for better maintainability.

6. **Dependency Injection**: Implement Hilt for dependency injection to improve testability and reduce tight coupling.

7. **Reactive Programming**: Use Kotlin Flows and LiveData for reactive updates to the UI.

### Key Technologies and Libraries

1. **Core Android Components**:
   - Kotlin as the primary language
   - AndroidX and Material Design for UI components
   - Navigation Component for fragment navigation
   - ViewModel and LiveData for UI state management

2. **Security**:
   - AndroidKeyStore for secure key storage
   - Biometric authentication API
   - AES-256 encryption for stored data

3. **Storage**:
   - Room Database for structured data storage
   - DataStore for preference storage (replacing SharedPreferences)

4. **Testing**:
   - JUnit for unit tests
   - Espresso for UI tests
   - Mockito for mocking dependencies

5. **Additional Libraries**:
   - Hilt for dependency injection
   - Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming
   - Timber for logging

### Difficult Points and Solutions

1. **Secure Storage of Sensitive Data**:
   - Challenge: Storing sensitive information securely on the device
   - Solution: Implement encryption/decryption using Android KeyStore and AES-256 encryption

2. **Handling Different Android API Levels**:
   - Challenge: Maintaining compatibility across different Android versions
   - Solution: Properly handle API differences (as seen in the Parcelable handling fix)

3. **User Authentication Security**:
   - Challenge: Ensuring only authorized users can access the app
   - Solution: Implement biometric authentication with fallback to master password

4. **Data Migration**:
   - Challenge: Moving from SharedPreferences to Room Database
   - Solution: Create a migration strategy that preserves user data during the upgrade

## Data structures and interfaces
The system will be organized according to the MVVM architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Data Layer**: Repositories, data sources, and models
2. **Domain Layer**: Use cases and business logic
3. **Presentation Layer**: ViewModels and UI components

The detailed class structure is provided in the `PasswordManagerApp_class_diagram.mermaid` file, which illustrates the relationships between the components.

## Program call flow
The sequence diagram in `PasswordManagerApp_sequence_diagram.mermaid` illustrates the main user flows:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - App launch and authentication with master password or biometrics
   - Handling authentication success and failures

2. **Password Management Flow**:
   - Listing passwords with proper decryption
   - Adding, viewing, editing, and deleting password entries

3. **Credit Card Management Flow**:
   - Similar to the password flow but for credit card entries

4. **Settings and Security Flow**:
   - Changing the master password
   - Exporting and importing backups
   - Managing biometric settings

5. **Initial Setup Flow**:
   - First launch experience
   - Creating a master password
   - Setting up biometric authentication

## Anything UNCLEAR
Based on the analysis of the existing codebase, there are a few aspects that may need clarification:

1. **Data Recovery Mechanism**: The current implementation doesn't seem to have a clear recovery path if the user forgets their master password. We should consider implementing security questions or a backup method to restore access.

2. **Security Auditing and Logging**: It's unclear if there's any logging of access attempts or security events. This would be valuable for security auditing and identifying potential unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Import/Export Format**: The exact format of exported data (JSON, encrypted binary, etc.) is not specified in the current implementation. We should define a standard format that balances security with portability.

4. **Offline vs. Cloud Sync**: The current implementation appears to be offline-only. We should clarify if cloud synchronization would be a future requirement and how that would impact the security model.

5. **Auto-Lock Behavior**: The conditions and timing for automatically locking the app (e.g., after a period of inactivity, when the app goes to the background) should be clearly defined.

6. **Password Strength Requirements**: We should establish minimum requirements for the master password strength to prevent users from setting weak passwords.
