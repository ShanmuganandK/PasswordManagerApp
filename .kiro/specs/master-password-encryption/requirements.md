# Master Password Encryption System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of a secure encryption system where the master password serves as the primary encryption key for all user data. The system will eliminate the storage of the master password hash and instead use the master password to encrypt/decrypt data, providing true zero-knowledge security where only the correct master password can decrypt the stored data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Master Password as Encryption Key

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my master password to be used as the encryption key for all my data, so that my data is truly secure and cannot be accessed without the correct master password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets up a master password THEN the system SHALL derive an encryption key from the master password using PBKDF2 with SHA-256
2. WHEN deriving the encryption key THEN the system SHALL use a cryptographically secure random salt of at least 32 bytes
3. WHEN deriving the encryption key THEN the system SHALL use at least 100,000 iterations for PBKDF2 to prevent brute force attacks
4. WHEN the encryption key is derived THEN the system SHALL use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
5. WHEN the master password is entered THEN the system SHALL NOT store the password or its hash anywhere on the device

### Requirement 2: Data Encryption and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my passwords and credit card information to be encrypted with my master password, so that my sensitive data is protected even if my device is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving password entries THEN the system SHALL encrypt all sensitive fields (password, username, notes) using AES-256-GCM
2. WHEN saving credit card entries THEN the system SHALL encrypt all sensitive fields (card number, CVV, holder name, notes) using AES-256-GCM
3. WHEN encrypting data THEN the system SHALL generate a unique IV (Initialization Vector) for each encryption operation
4. WHEN storing encrypted data THEN the system SHALL store the salt, IV, and encrypted data together
5. WHEN encrypting data THEN the system SHALL include authentication tags to prevent tampering

### Requirement 3: Authentication Through Decryption

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to verify my master password by attempting to decrypt my data, so that there is no stored password hash that could be compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their master password THEN the system SHALL attempt to decrypt a verification token
2. WHEN the decryption succeeds THEN the system SHALL grant access to the application
3. WHEN the decryption fails THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid master password" and deny access
4. WHEN setting up the master password THEN the system SHALL create and encrypt a verification token
5. WHEN no verification token exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for master password setup

### Requirement 4: Secure Key Management

**User Story:** As a security-focused user, I want the encryption keys to be handled securely in memory and never persisted, so that my keys cannot be recovered from device storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deriving encryption keys THEN the system SHALL clear the master password from memory immediately after use
2. WHEN encryption operations complete THEN the system SHALL clear encryption keys from memory
3. WHEN the app goes to background THEN the system SHALL clear all encryption keys from memory
4. WHEN the app is terminated THEN the system SHALL ensure no encryption keys remain in memory
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use secure memory practices to prevent key recovery

### Requirement 5: Migration from Current System

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current data to be migrated to the new encryption system, so that I don't lose my existing passwords and credit cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects existing unencrypted data THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to migrate
2. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all existing passwords and credit cards
3. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL remove the old password hash storage
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the original data and show an error message
5. WHEN migration is successful THEN the system SHALL verify all data can be decrypted correctly

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when encryption/decryption operations fail, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decryption fails due to wrong password THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid master password"
2. WHEN decryption fails due to corrupted data THEN the system SHALL display "Data corruption detected"
3. WHEN encryption operations fail THEN the system SHALL prevent data loss and show appropriate error messages
4. WHEN critical encryption errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors securely without exposing sensitive data
5. WHEN data cannot be decrypted THEN the system SHALL provide options for data recovery or reset

### Requirement 7: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the encryption and decryption operations to be fast enough that they don't significantly impact the app's responsiveness, so that security doesn't compromise usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing encryption operations THEN the system SHALL complete within 500ms for typical data sizes
2. WHEN decrypting data for display THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators for operations taking longer than 100ms
3. WHEN handling large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL perform encryption/decryption operations asynchronously
4. WHEN the user enters their master password THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on validation attempts
5. WHEN encryption operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent user actions that could cause data corruption

### Requirement 8: Security Validation and Testing

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the encryption implementation to follow industry best practices and be thoroughly tested, so that the system provides genuine security protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing encryption THEN the system SHALL use only well-established cryptographic libraries
2. WHEN generating random values THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generators
3. WHEN handling encryption keys THEN the system SHALL follow OWASP guidelines for key management
4. WHEN storing encrypted data THEN the system SHALL ensure no plaintext data is written to storage
5. WHEN testing the implementation THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all cryptographic operations
